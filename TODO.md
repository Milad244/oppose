# TODOs

### Feed

### Vision
- A scrolling feed with opinions you can either Accept of Oppose.
- The support/oppose ratio is hidden until you put it in your vote
- Maybe some kind of double tap (or button) will let you see the results while not being able to vote - acting as neutral.
- You can also just scroll past and then you won't see the results
- You will only be able to see the opposite view's comments. 
- Comments will have actual stakes as if it gets 5 opposes, it is removed. This way you only see the best comments from the other side.
- Of course you can comment and try to persuade the ppl with opposite views.
- Occoasionally an old post will come up for you to revote on. After this, the post is finalized and no more voting can happen. (This is not confirmed - big maybe)
- When posts are shared by a link, they are view only.
- We need some categories or tag system

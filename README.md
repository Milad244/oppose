# Oppose

## Access
Website: TBD

## Description
Oppose is a social media website dedicated to sharing and improving its usersâ€™ opinions. Each post works on a voting system where results are hidden until you pick a side (or skip). The comments on each post contain only the best arguments from the opposing view. Try and convince the other side the best you can, else your comment will be removed! For too long echo chambers and greedy algorithms have hidden the truth. With a user-first approach, Oppose changes that.
